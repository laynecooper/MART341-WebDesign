1) System fonts are the fonts already on your computer ready for you to use. These fonts aren't necessarily the best. Web fonts allow us to download the font files with the website we are using. Web-safe fonts are included with most computers and computer systems. Just because these web-safe fonts are installed, doesn't mean they become safe is somebody installs it. When using web-safe fonts, a designer will usually use font stacks or two or more fonts so that when the browser displays the font, it doesn't have to guess what it should use.

2) The importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack is that when a browser is trying to load the number one font of choice and it fails, the browser will have other choices to choose from in order to display the information neatly. But you want to make sure that you choose 2 fonts that compliment each other because if you have a font secondary font appear when loading the primary one it can effect layout, just as it shows on the module for week 11.

3) The challenges I had this week were just figuring out how to set up the fonts with the font-family, font size, font weight and the style of the element. Once I put them all together and checking in the browser, I made sure they looked good all put together and that's how I overcame that challenge.
