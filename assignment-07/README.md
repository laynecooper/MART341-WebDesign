1) On the web I have come across password inputs where I enter my password to enter a site (Moodle or Cyberbear). I have come across dropdown boxes or multiple choice when I am either taking a survey or taking a test on Moodle. An I have came across buttons (submit buttons) when I watch a youtube video. The purpose for all of these forms is to collect data from visitors/ followers.

2)
a) Text: text box when answering birth year, yes/no questions. When entering a password. And when entering Net ID. The usage of a text input is to collect the data from the visitor of your webpage to collect statistics or in the password example, to see if the person is qualified to enter your website and information.

b) Selection: the most obvious example I can think of is multiple choice whether thats a test or a survey. The purpose of selection is to find out information about someone by giving them multiple options and having them choose 1. And on a multiple choice test, seeing if they know the information to get the answer correct.

c) Button Input: Upload button, an image button such as to subscribe to a youtuber or follow someone on social media. I think the purpose of the button input is to allow people to easily submit information, whether that is to a teacher when submitting an assignment or adding someone to your social media.

3) This week was trickier than the rest, because there are more and more elements added that were added this week, but also things we had to remember from last week. The hardest part for me is the style of my table. I tried adding background color and text color, but it hasn't shown up in my preview so it's hard to know if I did it right.
