1) Learning HTML was completly new to me. I had heard of HTML, but hadn't ever learned what it was or why it was used. One of my favorite things I learned from HTML was how to embed a photo or a map. I never knew the amount of work that went into putting a picture on a website. Another things I learned about html was how to create forms and tables. Creating forms was fun for me because I see them all over the internet, even when taking tests on moodle and it was rewarding to understand what goes into those tables and forms and how to create them myself. The thing that was most difficult for me to learn was how to embed a video, at first it was hard for me to understand what the <iframe> element was and why we use it, but with week 8 and 9's assignments, I think i've gotten better at embedding.

2) I am excited to learn more about styling because it was one of my favorite parts so far. I think its fun to create backround colors, bold tables and text and see a simple webpage come together in something thats fun to look at.

3) For this week, my biggest challenge was creating the <nav> from site to site. It's tricky to know if you're doing it right before uploading to your repository. To get help and create my <nav> I watched the weekly video and went to the class website which helped greatly.
