                                      The <b>first</b> best resturaunt that we reccomend in Seattle is Hitchcock. This resturaunt is located on Bainbridge Island and has everything from oysters and a salmon tartare to a roasted chicken.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                  <p>
                                             The one we rated <b>second</b> best for a resturaunt in Seattle is Restaurante Marche. Here, they have phenomenal French options, one of which being a brown butter trout. This resturaint is located just a half mile from the dock of the ferry on Bainbridge Island.
                                      </p>

                                           The one we rated <b>third</b> best for a resturaunt in Seattle is Restaurante Marche. Here, they have phenomenal French options, one of which being a brown butter trout. This resturaint is located just a half mile from the dock of the ferry on Bainbridge Island.

                                    Our <b>fourth</b> best resturaunt, which was close to being third is Cafe Munir. Cafe Munir is located right in downtown Seattle and has lowpriced Middle Eastern Food. Their options include hummun with pine nuts, dips and spreads, and meat and vegtable kebabs.
                                  </p>

                                  Last, but not least in <b>fifth</b> we have the resturaunt Delancey. This is one of the best pizza places in the area. They have amazing pizza crust, pies, and even chocolate chip cookies.
                                </p>
