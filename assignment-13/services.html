            <h4>Asadero, Cafe Munir,Delancey</h4>
            <p>
              Asadero is just newly opened in Ballard, with its orininal location in Kent. The Kent location did so good they felt they should open a new location for those customers up North. Aserdro's focuses on meat dishes and they are open with a full bar from 11am to 10pm. Before Covid they were offering space of up to 90 guests inside the resturant.
            </p>

      <p>Cafe Munir is only open in the evenings from 5pm-8pm, whether that be to minimize contact with customers or if thats apart of their culture, it is a unique addition to Seattle. They require temperature checks and it seems they are also large on take out incuding links to uber eats and doordash on their home page.</p>

      <p>Delancey is also a resturaunt that is only open in the evenings from 5-9 pm. They are specialized in their dinner cuisine with their pizzas and deserts. You can email them or use Tock in order to order takeout.</p>
