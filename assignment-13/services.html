              Asadero is just newly opened in Ballard, with its orininal location in Kent. The Kent location did so good they felt they should open a new location for those customers up North. Aserdro's focuses on meat dishes and they are open with a full bar from 11am to 10pm. Before Covid they were offering space of up to 90 guests inside the resturant.
