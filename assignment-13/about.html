          Our evidence is backed by world famous chefs who are from all over the world. The chefs who have rated these resturaunts have been to cullinary school in places like France, Italy, and Austrilia.
       </div>
       <div class="col-6">
        No only do we use the recomendations from these chefs, but we also surveyed customers over a 6 month period on one random day of the week for 5 hours to get their take.

   <div class="row">
       <div class="col-6">
We look at sources like google ratings and yelp to help us narrow down our top 5 choices. We take into consideration the cost for the resturaunts and the ratings each resturaunt maintained overall.
       </div>
       <div class="col-6">
           The amount of options on the menu play a part in our rankings. Although, each resturaunt on our list has different cultures we wanted to get a mix of great options for our audience.

   <div class="row">
       <div class="col-12">
         Lastly, with the changing times of Covid, we picked resturaunts who have been maintained and supported by their customers. We feel that our website can help get the word out about these resturaunts and help with this difficult year.
