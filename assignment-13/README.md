1) I choose to use bootstrap because it is the most common out of all libraries and while I was going through the assignment I was using resources online to help me draw shapes and learn how to color them.

2) I used a CDN ( content delivery network) so that I wouldn't have to download and host Bootstrap myself.

3) HTML5 will open up more advanced options and capabilities to a greater audience. HTML is also seeming to make the web more secure, quicker and easier to use. Accordingly, HTML5 decreased the dependency on plugins and it uses more markups now, instead of scripting. And one of the most important things I noticed was that no matter what device you are using it produces a similar look.

4) The biggest challenge that I had was with bootstrap. I couldn't figure out the components I needed for my javascript folder. I used the example for this week to figure out what was suppose to be in my bootstrap.min.js and the popper.min.js and that is what helped me! I also had trouble with my navigation bar at the top of the page. I noticed it was more link style this week instead of the dropdown bar and i'm not top sure if its suppose to look like that. But they all still link to the correct places.
