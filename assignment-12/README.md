1) Padding is what gives you space in between the content of element and what the element is made up of, from the actual element. For example, when creating a table, you want to give yourself space from the contents of the table and the boarder of the table. A margin is the space between an element from another element. For example, giving yourself space from an image to a table. A boarder is what can help your table or chart really stand out. This week, we even used boarders in our dropdown blocks!

2) This week my biggest challenge was with the dropdown menu. I kept trying to reposition it so that it would align as horizontally and it took me a while to figure out and get all the correct elements I needed on the style css page. The video for this week is what helped me the most with this challenge. My table was sitting in front of my title and all my other font, so I asked how to reposition it in my check in for the week.
