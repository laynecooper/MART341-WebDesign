I went to Umt.edu to see what the University web page looked like in 2009. It looked very different than how our webpage looks now. For example there was only a few options you could choose from like graduate school, freshman, transfer students and scheduling a visit. Now in 2021 it has changed a great deal we have a lot of external sources we use rather than just the umt.edu website. We use Moodle, Cyberbear, ect.

I learned how to code a paragraph into atom, before learning that I wouldn't have known we had to add a paragraph element to make things look more neat. I also learned how to embed a screenshot into an about.html or a README.md. The last few assignments I was rocky on embedding the screenshots and make small mistakes. It is still difficult for me to add links to internal pages because on the markdown preview I can't tell if it will work or if it just appears to be a link.
